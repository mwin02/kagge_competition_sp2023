Group Members: Myo Zaw Win, Pyatyush Sahu, George Chong, Niha Malhotra

This is the github directory for GMNP team for CSE 151B's Spring 2023 Kaggle Competition. The models that we have been using and building can be found in the models directory and the saved model weights can be found in the saved_models. The final model weights that we submitted on Kaggle, acheiving a RMSE Loss of 700 was from the final_model.ipynb but we had some trouble saving the model weights for this. We tried running it again and we still had some trouble saving model weights but we were able to save the weights of a model that acheived 718 public RMSE Loss and that was the model weights that we saved in the saved_models directory.
